            PRIVACY POLICY
        </p>
        <p>
            This privacy policy governs your use of the software Pixel Starships (“Application”) for mobile and desktop devices that was created by Savy Soda Pty Ltd. The Application(s) are mobile games applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to Savy Soda Pty Ltd to help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the App has to offer. Our privacy policy details how we collect, store, and protect your information.

            The SavySoda Entity which you as a User entered an agreement with when using Pixel Starships will be the Controller for the User data as defined in the Directive and GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
            I. What Information Is Collected and Stored?
        </p>
        <p>
            We may collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Game: personally identifiable information ("PII") and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). Personally identifiable information is any information that can individually identify you and includes, among other things, information that you may supply to us when you visit the Website, e.g., your company name, your name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number. Non-personally identifiable information includes information that does not identify you personally, but it may include tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, use of the Website and the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            A. Personally Identifiable Information
        </p>
        <p>
            As a general matter, you can browse the Website and play the game without submitting your PII to us other than absolutely necessary such as ip address. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your PII, such as when you request customer service, logging into a social network or registering via email in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            B. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information From or Through Social Media Sites
        </p>
        <p>
            When you interact with any Savysoda.com social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or LinkedIn, we may collect the PII that you make available to us on that page or account including your account ID.
        </p>
        <p>
            C. Non-Personally Identifiable Information
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, when you interact with the Website and Game, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of the Website ("non-personally identifiable information" or "non-PII"), such as device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Website. This information may include IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information. We may also collect usage information about your use of the Website, such as a reading history of the pages you view, or additional "traffic data," such as the time and date of access, software crash reports, session identification number and referring website addresses. We use this information to provide you a more customized experience on the Game and Website.
        </p>
        <p>
            D. Collection of Personally and Non-Personally Identifiable Information From Other Sources
        </p>
        <p>
            We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources (including by us from our offline interactions with you) to, among other things, enable us to verify, update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your experience on the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
            E. Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies
        </p>
        <p>
            Like many online services, we use "cookies", which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to track use of our Website. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Website and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Website may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, check out our Cookie and Tracking FAQs or visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by unaffiliated third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your browser or device may include "Do Not Track" functionality. Because a "Do Not Track" compliance protocol has not yet been finalized, Savysoda.com's information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide to customers, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received. To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third party advertising partners by opting out, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

            III. Who Do We Share Your Information With?
        </p>
        <p>
            Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your personally identifiable information collected online to any organizations not part of Savysoda.com or its subsidiaries or related entities, except as described below. Although we may provide your information to our agents, affiliates, and partners, in no event will we sell or rent your PII as part of a customer list or similar transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            A. Third-Party Agents
        </p>
        <p>
            We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, marketing, analytics, and customer service. These entities may have access to personally identifiable information if needed to perform their functions. If such access is required, the third parties will be contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that PII. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Product.
        </p>
        <p>
            B. Business Partners and Other Third Parties
        </p>
        <p>
            We may share your personally identifiable information with our business partners or co-marketers from time to time. We may also share your PII with third parties that provide products and services that we think you may be interested in. You may withdraw your consent to our sharing of your PII with business partners and third parties at any time by following the opt-out process described below.
        </p>
        <p>
            C. Assignment
        </p>
        <p>
            We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Website. We may also sell certain assets associated with the Website. As a result, please be aware that in such event we may transfer some or all of your information to an entity acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged. Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            D. Law Enforcement, Legal Process, and Emergency Situations
        </p>
        <p>
            We may use or disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Website; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Website or our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Website or the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            E. Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information
        </p>
        <p>
            We may disclose or share non-personally identifiable information (or other information, other than PII) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. Among other things, we will disclose non-PII to third parties to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who our users are so we can improve our Website. We will also disclose non-PII to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            IV. How Can You Opt-Out?

You will not be permitted to examine the personally identifiable information of any other person or entity and may be required to provide us with personally identifiable information to verify your identity prior to accessing any records containing information about you. We may not accommodate a request to change or delete personally identifiable information if we believe doing so would violate any law or legal requirement, or cause the information to be incorrect.
        </p>

            We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process all opt-out and access requests in a timely manner.

        <p>
            How Long Do We Keep Personally Identifiable Information?
        </p>
        <p>
            The time period for which we keep information varies according to what the information is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as the comment sections of our Savysoda.com blog ("Public Social Features"), becomes public and anyone may take and use that information. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any personally identifiable information that you expect to keep private. Please consult the applicable guidelines, if any, for use of our Public Social Features for more information. Savysoda.com cannot control who views information that you post in public areas of the Sites and is not responsible for how third parties may use or disclose information that you post in public areas of the Sites.
