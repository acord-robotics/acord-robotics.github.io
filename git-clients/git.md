  Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source
  code during software development. Git is also used to coordinate work among
  programmers.

# Git

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git has been developed since 2005, when Linus Torvalds \(creator of the Linux operating system kernel\) created the open source project. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs \(Integrated Development Environments\). Git can be used online \(github.com\), or self-hosted \(git.mysite.com\), and you can make changes to files/issues via the website or various desktop clients \(Github Desktop, Gitkraken, etc\).

Every git directory is a full repository. A repository is a directory for a project. For example, Mojang would have a number of repositories \(also known as repos\). One of these would be Minecraft. In the minecraft repo, developers would be able to edit all the code \(which is compiled automatically\), as well as assign projects, create issues, and even add a wiki.

Git is best used for open source projects, as with most repos anyone can see the code. Users can create private repos, but for an organisation account to create a private repo, they usually have to have a premium git client \(github enterprise, Gitlab gold, for example\). Users are able to contribute to public projects and suggest changes through a feature called "push request", even if they aren't part of the project directly. Users are also able to see every commit \(contribution\) to the code, so if something works, they are able to see which commit changed what.

### History of Git

Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) gave up access to [BitKeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper), which was a sort of pre-runner to Git. Linus Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs. ToFor his design criteria, he specified that patching \(contributing\) should take no more than three seconds. He also required that there should be strong safeguards against viruses as well as corruption.

The development of Git began on 3 April 2005, and he announced the project on 6 April. Hestarted self-hosting it on 7 April. The first merge of multiple branches took place on 18 April, by a user called zMuggy. Torvalds achieved his performance goals; on 29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches to the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 patches per second.
