# The ACORD Portal

## Navigation

The Portal is currently located at http://allianceofdroids.org.au, however, once we've  got our new domain name, we will be moving it to http://portal.acord.org.au. http://acord.org.au will be the landing page that will link to all the sites on the left \(the link titles will be different\).
